## À propos

<br />

Welcome to PVonWeb, your solution for online minutes management!

Our application allows you to create, store, and share minutes efficiently and securely. With PVonWeb, you can also use advanced search tools to find specific minutes and access tracking features to monitor the progress of your minutes.

To get started with PVonWeb, you first need to register and create an account. Once logged in, you can access the user interface where you can create new minutes using our user-friendly form. You can also upload existing minutes in PDF or Word format.

PVonWeb is a convenient and useful tool for organizations that need to manage minutes in a professional and organized manner. We hope you enjoy using our application! If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.

PVonWeb is developed using the latest web technologies such as React.js for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end. We also used MongoDB databases to store minutes and user information.

Regarding security, PVonWeb uses encryption methods to protect sensitive data and security measures to protect against DDoS attacks. We have also implemented multi-factor authentication to enhance the security of user accounts.

Feel free to send us pull requests if you would like to contribute to the project. We are also open to feedback and suggestions to improve PVonWeb.
